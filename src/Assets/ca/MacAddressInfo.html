    <h2>Acció requerida</h2>
    Because of privacy concerns (ads), android does not allow apps to read your bluetooth mac-address any more.
    <br />
    But it's required to tell the other device where to send your data (like your home address).
    <br />
    To proceed, please insert your Bluetooth mac address below.
    <br />
    You can find it in the settings at <i>System <b>></b> About <b>></b> Bluetooth MAC address</i>.
    <br />
    If this address is invalid, you will not be able to receive any data!
