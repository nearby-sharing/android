# Nearby-Sharing-Windows
This repo contains a fully functional [implementation](ShortDev.Microsoft.ConnectedDevices.NearShare/) of the Microsoft `NearShare` protocol that can interop with the windows built-in sharing functionality ([See `Project Rome`]( https://github.com/microsoft/project-rome)).   
There's also an [android app](Nearby%20Sharing%20Windows/) to share (send and receive) files and websites between your phone and PC using this lib.

Visit [nearshare.shortdev.de](https://nearshare.shortdev.de) to get started!
