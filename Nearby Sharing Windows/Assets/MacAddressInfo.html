This feature is currently in alpha, please expect <i>slow</i> and <i>unreliable</i> transfers as well as any other kinds of bugs.
<br />
You can currently only receive one file at a time and the only transport available is bluetooth.
<br />
If you can't receive data check you settings, debug log and have a look at the FAQ (in the Settings).

<b><u>Required Action</u></b>
<br />
Because of privacy concerns (ads), android does not allow apps to read your bluetooth mac-address any more.
<br />
But it's required to tell the other device where to send your data (like your home address).
<br />
To proceed, please insert your Bluetooth mac address below.
<br />
You can find it in the settings at <i>System <b>></b> About <b>></b> Bluetooth MAC address</i>.
<br />
If this address is invalid, you will not be able to receive any data!
